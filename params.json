{"name":"Gosl","tagline":"Gosl -- Go scientific library","body":"### Welcome Gosl, a Go library for scientific computing.\r\nThis library contains functions to help with numerical methods, in particular, with the development of solvers for partial differential equations such as the Finite Element Method. Gosl contains a number of other Go packages, including:\r\n\r\n* **chk** \"Checking numerical calculations and testing\"),\r\n* **io**  \"Input and output of files and printing and parsing strings\"),\r\n* **utl** \"Utilities such as IntRange and LinSpace and allocators\"),\r\n* **mpi** \"A lightweight wrapper to MPI\"),\r\n* **la**  \"Linear algebra routines\"),\r\n* **plt** \"Plotting routines (wrapping matplotlib)\"),\r\n* **fdm** \"A simple finite differences solver\"),\r\n* **num** \"A few numerical methods\"),\r\n* **fun** \"Functions such as y=f(t,x)\"),\r\n* **ode** \"Solvers for ordinary differential equations\"),\r\n* **gm**  \"Geometry routines\"),\r\n* **tsr** \"Tensor algebra and calculus\"),\r\n* **vtk** \"3D visualisation with VTK\"),\r\n\r\nGosl is developed in/for Debian systems at the moment. It depends on a number of packages that can be installed as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev libhwloc-dev libsuitesparse-dev libmumps-dev \r\nsudo apt-get install libvtk5-dev python-scipy python-matplotlib dvipng\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nAfter installing Go (golang), type (don't forget the three dots):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo get github.com/cpmech/gosl/...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe documentation of Gosl, automatically generated with `go doc` [is available here](http://rawgit.com/cpmech/gosl/master/doc/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDorival Pedroso @cpmech and Raul Durand @RaulDurand.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nMost of Gosl was developed to support the numerical research that resulted in the following papers.\r\n1.
